**Introduction**

The purpose of this report is to evaluate the underlying relationships and patterns between and within each of the observed variables in the given dataset. Clustering is used to group the data to better understand the relationships and patterns across groups. Multiple predictive models are used to discover which group of employees is more likely to resign from their jobs, and what factors contribute to it. We choose accuracy and AUC as the evaluation metrics.

**Dataset Description**

Created by IBM data scientists, the dataset contains 1471 employeesâ€™ information including demographic, job-specific, and personal factors. It has 35 variables that include both numerical and categorical data.
